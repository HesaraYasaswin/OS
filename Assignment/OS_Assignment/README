For Compilation,

To compile the program, use the provided Makefile. Simply navigate to the directory containing the source files and run the following command:

- make

This will generate the executable file named "mssv".


For usage,

After compiling the program, you can run it from the command line. The program expects two arguments:

Here's the syntax to run the program

./mssv solution.txt 1

i ran this for example,

./mssv solution.txt 1



purpose of each file,

main.c - The purpose of this file is to be the programâ€™s main entry. It will read a sudoku solution from a file, process it, handle command-line arguments while creating threads in parallel that validate some results displayed on the console and, finally, release resources. 

threads.c - This file contains the implementation of thread creation, execution, and synchronization. 

results.c - The printing of validation results is handled by this file. 

input.c - This file handles reading the Sudoku solution from a file. 

cleanup.c -This file contains functions for cleaning up resources used by threads. 

sync.c - This file defines synchronization primitives such as mutex and condition variables. 

threads.h - header file for threads.c

results.c - header file for results.c

input.h - header file for input.c

cleanup.h - header file for cleanup.c

sync.h - header file for sync.c

Makefile - the makefile for these codes

solution.txt  - the valid test data that was given by the problem description.
